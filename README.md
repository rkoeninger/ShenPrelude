# ShenPrelude

### Unofficial Prelude library for Shen

The `pv` module requires the bitwise operators from CL and so only supports [shen-cl](https://github.com/Shen-Language/shen-cl).

Load by running `(load "prelude.shen")` in Shen.

Build docs by running `shen -l prelude.shen -l build.shen` on the command line.

View API docs for kernel functions and this prelude at [api.md](api.md).
